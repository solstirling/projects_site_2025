      This is my first, extremely basic, differential project. Due to my limited resources, it is mostly 3D Printed, and I scrapped the bearings from an old pinball machine my brother made, but it works just fine. The main goal of this project was to learn to design with custom bevel gears, which turned out to be extremely easy using Onshape. Below I talk about the design, build, and programming of this project.

        I used two Nema 17 Stepper motors to power it, because I wanted to use <a href="https://github.com/joshr120/PD-Stepper" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-700 transition-colors duration-200" target="_blank">PD Stepper</a> for control.
